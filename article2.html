<h1>Germany</h1>          
<p>
    Having been the victor of this past world cup it is only right that I give Germany the number one spot. The goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is unarguably the best in football. Thomas Mueller, Mario Gotze and Bastian Schweinsteiger already play year round with each for their club Bayern Munich. This is one of the many elements that adds to the best chemistry in world football.</p>

 

<h1>Colombia</h1>
<p>
    Although Colombia made a terrific run in this past world cup, they suffered from injuries as their best player Radamel Falcao was unable to perform due to a knee injury. James Rodriguez led the entire competition in goals scoring a total of 11. Rodriquez alongside Jackson Martinez was able to formulate one of the most threatening attacking forces in international football.</p>

 

<h1>Argentina</h1>
<p>
    I was rooting for Argentina from the beginning of the World Cup to win the tournament. Lionel Messi constantly showed his class by assisting team mate and creating opportunities. Unfortunately toward the end of the tournament Lionel Messi became less successful at finding the back of the net. Nevertheless Angel Di Maria and Sergio Aguero combined with Messi to form an excellent team</p>

 

<h1>Holland</h1>

<p>
    The Dutch has an excellent run in this past world cup. Robin Van Persie in the first game against spain scored one of the best goals I have ever seen in my life. Although many people criticize Arjen Robben for being a little too theatrical when it comes to contact in the penalty zone he still proved his talent scoring himself and setting up teammates. </p>

 

<h1>Brazil</h1>

<p>
    The host of World Cup 2014, Brazil, proved to be effective as they nearly reached the final. Neymar Jr at age 22 years old has already proven himself to be one of the best players in the world. His incredible speed and well as his ability to dribble past defender makes him an exceptional player. Oscar and David Luiz had very successful outing as they consistently found the back of the net throughout the tournament.</p>

<h1>Belgium</h1>

<p>
    Eden Hazard had an extremely successful World Cup in 2014. He is slowly proving himself as being one of the best players in world football. He plays extremely well paced and has an unrivaled level of balance and control. Romelu Lukaku also created many opportunities and was able to deliver multiple longshots at goal.</p>

<h1>Uruguay</h1>

<p>
    Uruguay was victim of a huge controversy in the World Cup when player Luis Suarez bit an opponent and was suspended for the rest of the tournament. Edinson Cavani was able put his best foot forward and lead Uruguay to a decent outing. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez combine to form one of the best striking forces in football.</p>

 <h1>France</h1>

<p>
    Karim Benzema, Paul Pogba and Franck Ribery are a winning formula for a successful football team. Benzema has been extremely efficient in close areas, creating opportunities as well as finding the back of the net himself. Paul Pogba is only 22 years old and is already proving himself to be a deadly midfielder. Although Ribery missed this past World Cup due to injury he would have been an excellent addition to their attacking squad. </p>
