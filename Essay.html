        <h1>About</h1>   
       <p> 
For my Final project I decided to create a website that correlates to my blog that I created this semester in my Communication Theory/Practice course. Given that I am a passionate soccer fan I decided to make a blog about international soccer. I wanted to make the information I posted on my website extremely basic and non-analytical so those who have no knowledge of the sport of soccer could easily understand the information being presented. Using the skills I learned this semester I was able design a site that shows my interest for the sport of soccer.

            <h1> Design </h1>
             <p>
Since I knew I would be incorporating vines into my website I knew I had to design something that would be media friendly. After doing a little research on the internet I was able to find a template that included a reel. Using this reel I was able to effectively embed each vine into the website. When you first visit the web page the vines automatically begin to play and you can scroll through the reel to view each particular vine. Using this template originally presented a big challenge to me. It was extremely difficult at first to figure out how to make any changes to the template. Using the skills I learned this semester however I was able to successfully alter the original coding of the template to my liking. Some of the big changes I made to the project were adding background images to the Website. After doing research online I was able to find images that I thought would work well with the theme. The main image I used as the background of the homepage is the infamous stadium Camp Nou. This is FC Barcelona's home stadium. It took me a while to make alterations to the pixels of the images but eventually I was able to find something that worked well. Given that the stadium is decorated in navy blue and maroon I decided to use the colors black and maroon for the design of my website.

Another big thing I added to my website was a navigation bar. I thought this was crucial to the design of my website so users could easily navigate their way to the different sections of the site. In my navigation bar I included the pages Home, Blog, About and Essay. I successfully linked all of these pages together so users could easily travel between different content section of the website. The blog section includes two articles I wrote for my Communications Theory/Practice course. These articles highlights the top ten  goal scorers in the world as well as the top ten international teams. I made the decision that these would be the best posts to implement into my website given that they cover the basics of international soccer. When you hover your mouse over the word "Blog" in the navigation bar a menu drops down listing the two articles. I also included an about page to briefly describe who I am and my website. Finally I linked this essay into the navigation bar for easy accessibility.

	The main difficulties I had with the website revolved around making alterations to the template. I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to properly embed the vines into the project. After making adjustments to the template I was able to successfully place vines into the reel.  As I would try to add new content to the website sometimes the original code of the template would prevent me from achieving the design I wanted. Other difficulties were mostly design related. It took a great deal of time for me to find a design that I thought looked professional. A great amount of time was spent through trial and error using different design schemes and applying different css styling. One of the main things I realized when designing my website is that the website doesn’t always come out the way you originally planned in your head. This makes styling a crucial part of the design process. Through effective styling content becomes more easily accessed. One nice trick that helped me get through the project was using the shortcut “command F” on my macbook. This allows me to search for keywords such as “article” or “font-size.” This made it much easier for me to navigate through the lengthy code of the template to find specifically what I was looking for.
