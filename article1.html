<h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>

    
<p> The debate between Ronaldo and Messi on who the best player in the world is one that continues to grow. So far this season Ronaldo has proved to be the best goalscorer in Europe. Ronaldo has scored 10 goals so far this season. Although he is often over zealous in his approach, when it comes to pure skill, Ronaldo is second to none. </p> 
    </li>
    

<li>

<h1>Lionel Messi</h1> 

<p>Messi, often given the title, as the best player of all time, has been having a great season. The little man from Argentina has scored 5 goals so far for FC Barcelona. Messi receives a great portion of his admiration from his style of the play. He is a great team player and never selfish with the ball. His left foot makes for arguably the most accurate strikes in all of soccer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

<h1>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h1>

<p>The 6â€™5 Swedish giant has proved himself to make it to the number 3 position. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has an extremely powerful foot. Although PSG are not having a tremendous start so far, Zlatan has nevertheless been proving his team with goals week after week.</p>
</li>
    <li>

<h1>Arjen Robben</h1>

<p>The Dutch Striker, Arjen Robben, proved himself in the world cup to be one of the best goal scorers in the world. Arjen Robben had an impressive outing in this past world cup scoring a total of 3 goals. Although he is known to dramatize minimal contact he still seems to find the back of the net almost every game.</p>

        </li>
    <li>

<h1>Luis Suarez</h1> 

<p>Luis Suarez was banned from play in the 2014 World Cup for biting an opponent. He has since been suspended for 3 months from all of soccer.

    <li>

<h1>Gareth Bale</h1> 

<p>The Welsh Midfield unfortunately was unable to participate in this past World Cup as his team failed to qualify. He has proven himself to be one of the best free kickers of all time. His unrivaled speed allows him to blow by defender and get in front of goal week after week.</p>

    <li>

<h1>Robin Van Persie</h1> 

<p>Robin Van Persie had arguably the most impressive goal in the entire World Cup. The Dutch striker dove nearly 10 feet to head a volley into the back of the net. He has been extremely reliable for Manchester United and appears to be getting better with age.</p>

    <li>
 
<h1>Yaya Toure</h1>
        
<p>Yaya has been an absolute sensation of Manchester City. He has been an incredibly reliable midfielder assisting nearly every player on Manchesters team. His free kick ability earns him a top ten spot on any list. </p>
